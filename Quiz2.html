   &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspI live in Georgia, looking to start work in the IT field.  Am having trouble 
   learning new concepts like git hub.  Although I understand it conceptually
   I have difficulty with the syntax and should be able to work it out with
   More practice
   <BR>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  Below I've added added a link to one of my favorite books
    'The Bourne Ultimatum' by Robert Ludlum.
